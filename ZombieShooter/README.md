This is the code served as the submission for end-of-semester group project of the subject NT106. 

We use the source code (below), expand its gameplay as well as make the game playable on LAN.

Currently, the project contains several forms for client side, 1 for server and a form for quick game testing. 

At first, we could not implement multiplayer feature due to time shortage. But after the report, seeing that our project had a lot of dedication and investment, our lecturer gave us another 2 weeks to complete.

We are really glad if you actually use our project for reference and further development :3

You can improve the smoothness of the game in some ways (idk), add more features, change the gameplay or publish the game to the internet.

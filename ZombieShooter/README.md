This is the code served as the submission for end-of-semester group project of the subject NT106. 
We use the source code (below), expand its gameplay as well as make the game playable on LAN.
Currently, the project contains several forms for client side, 1 for server and a form for quick game testing. 
We wished to develop this to have 4 players in a room, but time did not allow. That feature will be considered to be implemented by me (HikariL3) if I have time, yes ._____.

We are really glad if you actually use our project for reference and further development :3 

Should you have any questions regarding this project, please contact me via:
